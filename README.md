# Calculator
 This is a beginner level project that I have worked on as my course objective. It is basically works just like a calculator. First, you need to enter your first value. After that, you should pick an operation such as sum or divison. When you entered the second value you can see your result. As final part you can continue to your calculation with your final value if you want.
